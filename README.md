# Earthquake Damage Severity Prediction System

## Problem
Earthquakes are sudden natural disasters that can cause devastating damage to infrastructure, economic systems, and human lives. In countries located along the Ring of Fire—such as Indonesia—earthquakes occur frequently and often without warning.
One of the biggest challenges faced by disaster response agencies is the lack of early insight into the potential severity of damage after an earthquake occurs. Currently, assessments often rely on manual field reports or visual inspections, which take time and delay the response. In many emergency scenarios, critical decisions must be made within hours, yet the absence of accurate early predictions can result in misaligned response efforts.

## Justification
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides public access to a rich catalog of historical earthquake data, including seismic parameters such as magnitude, depth, time, and geographic location. Unfortunately, this valuable data is often underutilized for rapid risk assessment.
By leveraging historical earthquake records and identifying patterns in past damage outcomes, it is possible to develop a predictive system that estimates the level of damage immediately after an earthquake is detected. This kind of data-driven system can support real-time decisions during the critical golden hours, enabling agencies like BNPB (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana), BMKG, and local governments to:
•	Prioritize high-risk areas more effectively
•	Deploy emergency resources faster
•	Minimize infrastructure loss and casualties
Such a system could greatly enhance national disaster preparedness and response strategies, particularly in vulnerable and densely populated areas.

## Project Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning–based system to predict the damage severity level caused by an earthquake, based on available seismic data.
The specific goals are:
1.	Build a classification model to estimate the level of earthquake damage (e.g., minor, moderate, or severe), using key features such as:
o	Magnitude
o	Depth
o	Geographic location (latitude and longitude)
o	Distance to populated areas
o	Time of occurrence
2.	Provide early insight for disaster management agencies such as BNPB to:
o	Allocate rescue teams and resources to the most affected zones
o	Prioritize distribution of aid
o	Communicate effectively with stakeholders and affected communities
3.	Support long-term planning by analyzing historical damage patterns, contributing to better urban planning, infrastructure development, and resilience-building in high-risk zones.
